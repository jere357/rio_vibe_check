## Rio vibe checker

I've written 0 lines of code for this "project"

You know how it is, the first 2 weeks of an expansion numbers are stupid and you wanna see if the person who queued is a good m+ player, the team over at tjelesni gaming has devised a solution better than rio, and faster than going to the person's armory page, all in 1 css 1 html and 1 js file with 0 dependencies. gpto1 is a very good model.

How to use if you somehow found this and are non-technical:

1. Figure out how to download these 3 files (click on the green code button and press download as zip).

2. Press `index.html` and judge away.
